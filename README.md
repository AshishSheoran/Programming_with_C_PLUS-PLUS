The motivation behind this task is to put your C++ Object Oriented aptitudes to rehearse by building up a reenacted Assembly Line. 
The undertaking reproduces a mechanical production system that dispatches client orders from stock. Every client request comprises of a rundown of things that should be filled. The line comprises of a bunch of stations. Each station holds a stock of things for taking care of client orders and a line of requests to be filled. Each station dispatches the following request in the line if that request demands its thing and that thing is as yet in stock. A line director moves the client orders from station to station until all requests have been handled. Any station that has utilized the entirety of the things in stock can't take care of additional requests. Requests become deficient because of an absence of stock at least one stations. Toward the finish of all preparing, the line administrator records the finished requests and the requests that are inadequate.
